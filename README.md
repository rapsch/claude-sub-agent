## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start a new project workflow
Ask Claude: "Use the spec-orchestrator agent to create a todo list web application"

# The orchestrator will automatically:
# 1. Analyze requirements
# 2. Design architecture
# 3. Plan tasks
# 4. Implement code
# 5. Write tests
# 6. Review and validate
```

### Simple Example

```markdown
You: Use spec-orchestrator to create a personal blog platform

Claude (spec-orchestrator): Starting workflow for personal blog platform...

[Planning Phase - 45 minutes]
âœ“ Requirements analyzed
âœ“ Architecture designed
âœ“ Tasks planned
âœ“ Quality Gate 1: PASSED (96/100)

[Development Phase - 2 hours]
âœ“ 15 tasks implemented
âœ“ Tests written
âœ“ Quality Gate 2: PASSED (88/100)

[Validation Phase - 30 minutes]
âœ“ Code reviewed
âœ“ Final validation complete
âœ“ Quality Gate 3: PASSED (91/100)

Project complete! Generated artifacts:
- requirements.md
- architecture.md
- Source code (15 files)
- Test suites (85% coverage)
- Documentation
```

## How It Works

### 1. Claude Code Sub-Agents Integration

According to Claude Code's documentation, sub-agents work by:

- Operating in isolated context windows
- Preventing pollution of the main conversation
- Allowing specialized, focused interactions
- Being automatically selected based on task context

Our system leverages these features by creating specialized agents for each development phase.

### 2. Workflow Phases

#### Planning Phase

1. **spec-analyst**: Analyzes requirements and creates user stories
2. **spec-architect**: Designs system architecture
3. **spec-planner**: Breaks down work into tasks
4. **Quality Gate 1**: Validates planning completeness

#### Development Phase

1. **spec-developer**: Implements code based on tasks
2. **spec-tester**: Writes comprehensive tests
3. **Quality Gate 2**: Validates code quality

#### Validation Phase

1. **spec-reviewer**: Reviews code for best practices
2. **spec-validator**: Final production readiness check
3. **Quality Gate 3**: Ensures deployment readiness

### 3. Agent Communication

Agents communicate through structured artifacts:

- Each agent produces specific documents
- Next agent uses previous outputs as input
- Orchestrator manages the flow
- Quality gates ensure consistency

## Agent Reference

### Agent Classification System

Our agents are organized into specialized categories for better organization and domain expertise:

- **spec-agents/**: Core workflow orchestration agents
- **backend/**: Backend system specialists
- **frontend/**: Frontend development specialists  
- **ui-ux/**: User experience and design specialists
- **utility/**: General-purpose utility agents

### Core Workflow Agents (spec-agents/)

| Agent | Purpose | Inputs | Outputs |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| spec-orchestrator | Workflow coordination | Project description | Status reports, routing |
| spec-analyst | Requirements analysis | User description | requirements.md, user-stories.md |
| spec-architect | System design | Requirements | architecture.md, api-spec.md |
| spec-planner | Task planning | Architecture | tasks.md, test-plan.md |
| spec-developer | Implementation | Tasks | Source code, unit tests |
| spec-tester | Testing | Code | Test suites, coverage reports |
| spec-reviewer | Code review | Code | Review report, improvements |
| spec-validator | Final validation | All artifacts | Validation report, quality score |

### Specialist Agents by Category

#### Backend Specialists (backend/)
| Agent | Domain | Integration Point |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| senior-backend-architect | Backend Systems & Architecture | Architecture/Development phase |

#### Frontend Specialists (frontend/)
| Agent | Domain | Integration Point |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| senior-frontend-architect | Frontend Systems & Architecture | Development phase |

#### UI/UX Specialists (ui-ux/)
| Agent | Domain | Integration Point |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| ui-ux-master | User Experience & Interface Design | Planning/Development phase |

#### Utility Agents (utility/)
| Agent | Domain | Integration Point |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| refactor-agent | Code Quality & Refactoring | Any phase |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Enterprise Application

```bash
# High-quality enterprise system
Use spec-orchestrator with quality threshold 95:
Create an enterprise CRM system with:
- Multi-tenancy support
- Role-based access control
- RESTful API
- Real-time dashboard
- Audit logging
```

### Example 2: Quick Prototype

```bash
# Fast prototype with lower quality threshold
Use spec-orchestrator with quality threshold 75 and skip analyst:
Create a simple landing page with email capture
```

### Example 3: Existing Requirements

```bash
# Start from existing documentation
Use spec-orchestrator starting from requirements:
Load requirements from ./docs/requirements.md and continue workflow
```

### Example 4: Specific Phase Only

```bash
# Run only validation on existing code
Use spec-orchestrator for validation phase only:
Validate the project in ./my-app/
```

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Planning Quality (95% threshold)

- Requirements completeness

- Monitor resource usage

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows

```python
# Create custom workflow configuration
workflow_config = {
    "quality_threshold": 90,
    "skip_agents": ["spec-analyst"],  # If you have requirements
    "parallel": True,
    "custom_validators": ["security-scan", "performance-test"],
    "output_format": "markdown"
}

# Execute with custom config
"Use spec-orchestrator with config: " + json.dumps(workflow_config)
```

### Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: AI Workflow Validation
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Spec Validation
        run: |
          # Use Claude Code CLI (if available)
          claude-code run spec-orchestrator \
            --phase validation \
            --project-path .
```

### Extending the System
